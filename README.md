# SqlAlchemy_Challenge
Surfâ€™s Up

This challenge is to perform a climate analysis using the data collected from 2010 to 2017 in Honolulu, Hawaii. This is done in 2 steps:
1)  **Analyze and Explore the Climate Data** - Do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib.
2)  **Design Climate App** - After completing the initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that were just developed.
