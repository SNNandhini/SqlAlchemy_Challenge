# SqlAlchemy_Challenge
Surfâ€™s Up

This challenge is to perform a climate analysis using the data collected from 2010 to 2017 in Honolulu, Hawaii. This is done in 2 steps:
1)  **Analyze and Explore Climate Data** - Do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib.
2)  **Design Climate App** - After completing the initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that were just developed.  

##  Analyze and Explore Climate Data
This step involves analysing Hawaii Precipitation and Weather Stations data. 

For this, the connection between Python and SQLite Database is established by performing the following steps:
1)  Use the SQLAlchemy **create_engine()** function to connect to the SQLite database.
2)  Use the SQLAlchemy **automap_base()** function to reflect the tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named Station and Measurement.
3)  Link Python to the database by creating a **SQLAlchemy session**.
